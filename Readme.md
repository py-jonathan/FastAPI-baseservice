# I want this repo can make me a server to handle HTTP requests, WS requests, GRPC as soon as possible ( < 1 days) 
1. I always use body in http request, ignore use param query


2. if you have a lot of domains, we can break specificly like auth, posts, messages ... in every folder we have router, schemas, models, ... but I like separate files like api, curd, models ... . If we have many domains, we should break to another services.
